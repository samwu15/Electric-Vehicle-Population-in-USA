My code primarily implements the following steps to evaluate multiple classification models on a dataset and analyze whether they exhibit overfitting or underfitting.
I defined eight different classification models, including:
  Logistic Regression (LogisticRegression)
  Support Vector Classification (SVC)
  K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNeighborsClassifier)
  Decision Tree (DecisionTreeClassifier)
  Random Forest (RandomForestClassifier)
  Bagging Classifier (BaggingClassifier)
  Extra Trees Classifier (ExtraTreesClassifier)
  AdaBoost Classifier (AdaBoostClassifier)
I used the .score() method to compute the accuracy of each model on the training and testing sets.
I calculated the score differences between the training and testing sets for each model to assess the presence of overfitting (i.e., when the model performs significantly better on the training set than on the testing set).
By judging the scores from the training and testing sets, you applied a set of rules to categorize each model's performance.
I created a Pandas DataFrame that displays the model names, training scores, testing scores, the difference between training and testing scores, and the evaluation status of the models, helping to compare their performances visually.
